### HTML

This is an example of a HTML comment:

```HTML
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

Everything in the comment will not run or show up in the browser. Developers uses code comments to take notes on certain pieces of code, or have TODOS, or even to not show a block of code without deleting it. Every programming language has its own commenting syntax.

## Header
Anything that is inside of a **Header** tags goes on top of the page and this is usually used for the nav bar for the pages' logo and links to other pages.

```HTML
<header></header>
```
