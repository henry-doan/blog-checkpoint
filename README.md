## HTML
HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is a programming language that is used to display content for web pages. It is sometimes referred to the skeletons of web pages, providing the foundation of the content for web pages.

### Syntax
Every programming language has different ways to write in the language, this is called **Syntax**. The **Syntax** for the HTML language has and opening and closing tag, with content in between. Opening tags in HTML starts with a less than symbol < then the tag keyword and finally a less than symbol >. Closing tags have the same format but a / before the tag keyword to show that it is an ending tag.

```HTML
<p>Content goes here</p>
```

Here is a resource that shows all the HTML tags

### Comment
This is an example of a HTML comment:

```HTML
<!-- This is a HTML comment -->
```

Everything in the comment will not run or show up in the browser. Developers uses code comments to take notes on certain pieces of code, or have TODOS, or even to not show a block of code without deleting it. Every programming language has its own commenting syntax.You can also do single line comments or multi-line comments as well.

This is an example of a single line html comment:

```HTML
<!-- This is a single line HTML comment -->
```

This is an example of a multi-line html comment:

```HTML
<!-- 
    This is a 
    multi-line 
    HTML comment 
-->
```

### Header
Anything that is inside of a **Header** tags goes on top of the page and this is usually used for the nav bar for the pages' logo and links to other pages.

```HTML
<header></header>
```

### Footer
Like the Header tag anything that is inside of the **Footer** tags, it will show up on the bottom of the web page. This is used primarily for web pages' footers. 

```HTML
<footer></footer>
```

## CSS

This is an example of a css comment:

```CSS
/* This is a CSS comment */
```

Like HTMl comment and every comment everything in the comment will not run or show up in the browser. The same purposes as a HTML comments. You can also do single line comments or multi-line comments as well.

This is an example of a single line css comment:

```CSS
/* This is a single line CSS comment */
```

This is an example of a multi-line css comment:

```CSS
/* 
    This is a 
    multi-line CSS
